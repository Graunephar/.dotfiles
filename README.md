# Graunephars .dotfiles

All of my .dotfiles will eventually be collected here. Mostly for my own reference. 

But you are more than welcome to have a look and copy the things you like.


# Installation


The repo uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to handle installation

run ./install to install all the things on a mac 

## Linux installation

Next step is to write a seperat script that can install most of the setup on an ubuntu based system as well.
